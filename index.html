<ul>
<li>The web app is able to run on mobile devices like an app would. The
interface is similar to that of Quora / Twitter/Play newstand.</li>
<li>The website displays the latest news and upcoming and on-
going events and highlights in the form of posts which can be expanded to view additional information. </li>
<li>Also the name of the author and the date on which it was published are posted. On expanding the post additional material including images and details are displayed.</li>
<li>Also it has an option to like, comment and even share on facebook. For doing that one has to sign-up first with a valid email-id. To check that the email-id provided in the sign-up form is authentic, an email with an authentication link is sent to the given email-id.</li>
<li>The homepage will contain recent/top highlights. This page will also contain tabs for the various councils and senate. On clicking the posts are filtered out and the posts of the related council are displayed. </li>
<li>We have also implemented a search feature for the posts. A person can search either on the home page or on a council specific page. </li>
<li>For each council on the left side-bar there is important information related to that council eg. the name and contact details of the various coordinators of the clubs of that council.</li>
</ul>
